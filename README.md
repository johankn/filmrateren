## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://gitlab.stud.idi.ntnu.no/it2810-h23/Team-5/prosjekt-2.git
```


Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd Filmrateren/
```


### 2. Navigate to the backend-repository and start the server by running the following commands:

cd backend
npm install
npm start
```

### 3. In a new terminal, navigate to the frontend-repository and start the client by running the following commands:

Then, open local host (as shown in terminal) with your browser to view the project.

### 4. Run the tests we have so far:
